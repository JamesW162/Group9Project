# Spell-checker Script - Code Explanation

This document explains a simple Python script that uses the `autocorrect` library to correct spelling errors in text provided as a command-line argument.

## Importing the Necessary Library

```python
from autocorrect import Speller
import sys
```

This code imports two essential components:
- `Speller` from the `autocorrect` library, which provides spell-checking functionality
- `sys` module, which allows access to command-line arguments

## Getting Input Text from Command Line

```python
input_text = sys.argv[1]
```

This line captures the first command-line argument after the script name and assigns it to the variable `input_text`.

- `sys.argv` is a list containing all command-line arguments
- `sys.argv[0]` is the script name itself
- `sys.argv[1]` is the first actual argument passed to the script, which in this case is the text to be spell-checked

## Creating a Spell Checker Instance

```python
speller = Speller()
```

This creates an instance of the `Speller` class from the `autocorrect` library. The `Speller` object will be used to check and correct spelling errors.

By default, the `Speller` is set up for English language correction, but it can be configured for other languages as well by passing parameters.

## Correcting Spelling and Outputting Results

```python
print(speller(input_text))
```

This final line:
1. Passes the input text to the `speller` object, which processes the text and corrects any spelling errors it finds
2. Prints the corrected text to the console

The `speller` object acts like a function that takes text input and returns corrected text.

## Usage Example

To use this script (let's call it `spellcheck.py`), you would run it from the command line like this:

```
python spellcheck.py "I have a speeling mistacke in this sentance"
```

The script would output:
```
I have a spelling mistake in this sentence
```
