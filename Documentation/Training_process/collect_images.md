# Image Collection Script - Code Explanation

This document explains the functionality of `collect_images.py`, which captures images from a webcam to create a dataset for hand gesture recognition, with direct quotes from the code.

## Imports and Setup

The script begins by importing the necessary libraries:

```python
import os
import cv2
```

- `os` is used for file and directory operations
- `cv2` (OpenCV) is used for camera access and image processing

## Creating Data Directory

The script prompts the user for a folder name and creates a directory to store the images:

```python
# Get user input for folder name
folder_name = input("Enter the folder name for data collection: ")
DATA_DIR = os.path.join('./data', folder_name)
if not os.path.exists(DATA_DIR):
    os.makedirs(DATA_DIR)
```

This code:
1. Asks the user to enter a name for the folder (typically a gesture name like "thumbs_up")
2. Creates a path to the folder within a `data` directory
3. Creates the directory if it doesn't already exist

## Configuration

The script sets the number of images to collect and initializes the camera:

```python
# Number of images to collect
dataset_size = 100

cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0)  # Use 0 for the default camera
if not cap.isOpened():
    print("Error: Could not open video device.")
    exit()

print(f'Collecting data in folder: {folder_name}')
```

This section:
1. Sets `dataset_size` to 100, meaning 100 images will be captured
2. Initializes the default camera (index 0)
3. Checks if the camera opened successfully, exiting with an error message if not
4. Confirms to the user which folder the images will be saved in

## Waiting for User to Start

The script shows a live camera feed and waits for the user to press 'F' to start the image collection:

```python
# Displays Camera in frame with text prompting the user to start. Exits if camera not found or 'f' pressed.
while True:
    ret, frame = cap.read()
    if not ret:
        print("Failed to capture image")
        break

    cv2.putText(frame, 'Press F to start', (100, 50), cv2.FONT_HERSHEY_SIMPLEX, 1.3, (0, 255, 0), 3,
                cv2.LINE_AA)
    cv2.imshow('frame', frame)
    if cv2.waitKey(25) == ord('f'):
        break
```

In this loop:
1. The script continuously captures frames from the camera
2. It adds the text "Press F to start" to each frame
3. It displays the frame in a window named 'frame'
4. It waits for the user to press 'F' to exit the loop and proceed

## Capturing Images

Once the user presses 'F', the script captures the specified number of images:

```python
# Takes number of pictures specified by dataset_size. stores in data/{label}
for counter in range(dataset_size):
    ret, frame = cap.read()
    if not ret:
        print("Failed to capture image")
        break

    cv2.imshow('frame', frame)
    cv2.waitKey(25)
    cv2.imwrite(os.path.join(DATA_DIR, f'{counter}.jpg'), frame)

    print(f"Captured image {counter}/{dataset_size}")
```

This loop:
1. Iterates `dataset_size` times (100 by default)
2. Captures a frame from the camera
3. Displays the frame to the user
4. Waits 25 milliseconds between frames (about 40 frames per second)
5. Saves t
